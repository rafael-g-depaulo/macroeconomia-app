export const aboutUs = `*Structuralist Development Macroeconomics* is defined by Bresser-Pereira, Oreiro and
Marconi (2014, p.56) as “the economic theory that explains economic development as a
historical process of capital accumulation, incorporating technological progress and
structural change, in which accumulation depends on the existence of profitable
investment opportunities offered by sustained growth of demand, which, in tum,
depends on the balanced increase of the domestic market and of exports, which, finally,
depends on the exchange rate to fluctuate around the equilibrium, instead of being
chronically and cyclically overvalued, as is often the case in developing countries”

The research group was founded in 2008 by José Luis Oreiro, Professor of Economics
Department at University of Brasília, Brazil. Some researchers from the research group
have been doing joint work for a long period, many of them published in economic
journals in Brazil and abroad such as the *Brazilian Journal of Political Economy,
Metroeconomica, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, Review of Political
Economy, Cepal Review, Investigación Económica, Journal of Post Keynesian
Economics, Cambridge Journal of Economics, International Review of Applied
Economics*, among others. It is worth noting the high productivity of the group
members, many of whom are Cnpq level I researchers. Within the scope of this research
group, the book &quot;Developmental Macroeconomics: new developmentalism as a growth
strategy&quot; was organized published by Routledge, UK, in 2015. Also noteworthy is the
publication of the book &quot;Moeda e Sistema Financeiro: ensaios em homenagem a
Fernando Cardim de Carvalho&quot; in 2019.

The research group is registered at Research Groups Directory of the Council for
Technological and Scientific Research (CNPq) of the Brazilian Government (Diretório
dos Grupos de Pesquisa do CNPQ) and certified by the University of Brasília (UnB).
The address of the group in the directory can be seen at
